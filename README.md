What is it?
-----------
The Pan Galactic Engineering Framework (pangalactic) is an open-architecture,
standards-based software framework for engineering applications such as systems
engineering data and tool integration, product lifecycle management (PLM),
computer-aided tools (CAX) integration, collaborative systems engineering,
design, and analysis, and multi-disciplinary product model capture,
integration, synthesis, and transformation.

Installation
------------
For detailed instructions see the file INSTALL in the pangalactic.core package.

Documentation
-------------
Rudimentary documentation is in NOTES.md and in the script template files
in pangalactic/vger:

  - run_cb_crypto.sh.template
  - run_vger_debug.sh.template

... new docs coming soon.

Acknowledgments
---------------
Pangalactic depends on several excellent open source libraries,
applications, and frameworks, most notably:

  - Python ...... http://www.python.org
  - Twisted ..... http://twistedmatrix.com (Twisted Matrix Laboratories)
  - Autobahn .... https://pypi.org/project/autobahn

Thanks to all the talented and dedicated folks who have developed and
continue to maintain those packages and others in the formidable open
source code base that makes the Pan Galactic Engineering Framework
possible!

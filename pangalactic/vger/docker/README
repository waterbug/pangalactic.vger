BUILDING
--------
* check that 'build.sh' has correct version of vger
* copy server cert for localhost into ./server_cert.pem
* add a copy of the latest 'Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh'
* add or copy a local 'config' file
* add the vger private key file as 'vger.key'
  (this corresponds to its public key in crossbar's "principals" database)
* add or copy 'extra_data' directory containing .yaml files, if appropriate
* copy 'run_vger_template.sh' to 'run_vger.sh' and edit so it has correct:
  - version of vger image
  - location for 'principals.db' (which vger writes to and crossbar
    authenticator reads from)

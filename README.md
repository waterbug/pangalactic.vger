What is it?
-----------
The Pan Galactic Engineering Framework (pangalactic) is an open-architecture,
standards-based software framework for engineering applications such as systems
engineering data and tool integration, product lifecycle management (PLM),
computer-aided tools (CAX) integration, collaborative systems engineering,
design, and analysis, and multi-disciplinary product model capture,
integration, synthesis, and transformation.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation available as of the date of this release is in the doc
directory.

Installation
------------
For detailed instructions see the file INSTALL in this directory.

Acknowledgments
---------------
Pangalactic depends on several excellent open source libraries,
applications, and frameworks, most notably:

Python ...... http://www.python.org    (Python Labs and Zope Corporation)
PyQt ........ https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro
Twisted ..... http://twistedmatrix.com (Twisted Matrix Laboratories)
Autobahn .... http://autobahn.ws/python/index.html

Thanks to all the talented and dedicated folks who have developed and
continue to maintain those packages and others in the formidable open
source code base that makes the Pan Galactic Engineering Framework
possible!

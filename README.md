What is it?
-----------
The Pan Galactic Engineering Framework (pangalactic) is an open-architecture,
standards-based software framework for engineering applications such as systems
engineering data and tool integration, product lifecycle management (PLM),
computer-aided tools (CAX) integration, collaborative systems engineering,
design, and analysis, and multi-disciplinary product model capture,
integration, synthesis, and transformation.

pangalactic.vger is the pangalactic server package, which implements rpc and
pubsub interfaces.

---------------
Pangalactic depends on several excellent open source libraries,
applications, and frameworks, most notably:

Python ...... http://www.python.org    (Python Labs and Zope Corporation)
PyQt ........ https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro
Twisted ..... http://twistedmatrix.com (Twisted Matrix Laboratories)
Autobahn .... http://autobahn.ws/python/index.html

Thanks to all the talented and dedicated folks who have developed and
continue to maintain those packages and others in the formidable open
source code base that makes the Pan Galactic Engineering Framework
possible!

Deploying Dockerized crossbar and vger
======================================

Running the crossbar image with cryptosign auth over tls
--------------------------------------------------------

* set up a "home" directory for crossbar, e.g. /var/lib/crossbar, setting its
  ownership to the crossbar user (uid 242) and group (gid 242).  Any files
  added to the directory should be owned by that user and group.
* create a '.crossbar' directory under the crossbar "home" directory
* copy the file 'crossbar_config_crypto_tls.json' from the pangalactic.vger
  repository (pangalactic.vger/pangalactic/vger) into the '.crossbar'
  directory, renaming the file to 'config.json'
* copy the file 'authenticator.py' from the pangalactic.vger
  repository into the crossbar "home" directory.
* copy the file 'principals.json.template' from the pangalactic.vger repository
  (pangalactic.vger/pangalactic/vger) into the '.crossbar' directory under
  crossbar's "home" directory, renaming the file to 'principals.json' and
  editing it as appropriate to add the vger public key and an initial set of
  users with public keys, including at least an initial Global Administrator
  so that more users can be added at runtime.
* add a certificate file and a key file for the host machine into the
  '.crossbar' directory under crossbar's "home" directory, naming them
  'server_cert.pem' and 'server_key.pem', respectively, and setting the
  permissions on 'server_key.pem' to 400.

Building and running the vger docker image
------------------------------------------

NOTE:  it is ok to do the build inside the 'docker' directory of the
pangalactic.vger git repository -- git will ignore 'build.sh', 'Dockerfile',
'Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh', 'run_vger_detached.sh', and
'run_vger_interactive.sh'

* copy 'build_template.sh' to 'build.sh'
* set version of vger in 'build.sh' to the correct version
* add a copy of the latest "miniconda" install script for python 3.7
  and rename it to 'Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh'
* copy 'Dockerfile_template' to 'Dockerfile' and modify as necessary (e.g.
  setting the crossbar "home" directory)
* create a local "home" directory for vger, e.g. /var/lib/vger, setting its
  ownership to the crossbar user (uid 242) and group (gid 242).
  - copy the server certificate file for the host into the vger "home"
    directory, naming the file 'server_cert.pem'.
  - give group "crossbar" read access to 'server_cert.pem'.
  - copy 'config_template' into the vger "home" directory, renaming it to
    'config' and adjusting its contents as necessary.  (N.B.: "console: true"
    will redirect output to stdout and will *not* write to the logs, so it
    should only be use when the container is run interactively for testing, and
    should not be used in production.)
  - give group "crossbar" read/write access to the 'config' file.
  - add the vger private key file as 'vger.key' (this must correspond to the
    public key for the 'vger' user in crossbar's "principals" database).
  - give group "crossbar" read access to 'vger.key'.
  - create an 'extra_data' directory inside the vger "home" directory.  Its
    purpose is to hold .yaml files of any installation-specific serialized
    objects that vger should load when starting up or restarting.
  - give group "crossbar" read/execute access to 'extra_data' and read access
    to any files it contains.
* copy 'run_vger_interactive.template.sh' to 'run_vger_interactive.sh'
  (or for production, copy 'run_vger_detached.template.sh' to
  'run_vger_detached.sh') and edit so it has the correct:
  - version spec for the vger image
  - location for 'principals.db', which will be in the crossbar "home"
    directory -- i.e., make sure the crossbar "home" directory (set in the
    crossbar docker image procedure above) is bind-mounted to
    '/vger_home/crossbar' (its location in the vger image).
    NOTE:  This crossbar is configured to use the authenticator module,
    'authenticator.py', to create, write to and read from 'principals.db' and
    vger writes to it, which is why it is essential that the vger container
    runs internally as the same user [uid 242] that the crossbar container runs
    as internally.
  - N.B.:  'run_vger_detached.sh' should *only* be used for the initial start
    up of the vger container.  Thereafter, 'docker stop' and 'docker start'
    should be used to stop and start the container (use 'docker ps' to locate
    the container and get its status).  This is essential so that the vger
    database has continuity between restarts, because the database lives in an
    anonymous docker volume that is created by the container at startup and is
    "owned" by that container.
